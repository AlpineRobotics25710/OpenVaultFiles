	"Description": "Our drivetrain is sitting at a compact 31 x 31 cm footprint, this allow more maneuverability in the field while still fit for a 4in wheels (or larger), and 2 or 3 dead wheel odometry setup. Most unique thing are the wheels which is chain driven with a custom 3D printed dead axle adapter, chain drives allow less slips and could be easily modified if necessary in the future, and dead axles allow for smoother wheels and make it less noisy.",
