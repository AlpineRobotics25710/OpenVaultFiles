    "description": "Many new rookie teams struggle to make a compact and effective claw design, so think of this OS CAD as simple place to start.Our claw takes inspiration from other open source claws and makes it accessible to anyone!We are currently using this claw, and it has served us well, it may not look the best, but it is very simple to build and use.Most of the claw is 3D printed, so any team can use it.When we designed this claw, the main thing that was kept in mind was versatility. We chose to make our claw able to function with the least amount of bought parts possible. We made the mount with a standard servo, and any gobilda servo works with it.",
